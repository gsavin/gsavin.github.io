    As one of the two web developpers of a small agile team, I was in charge of replacing an old silverstripe backend with a new GraphQL-based one, that would be maintained in-house and that should be generic enough to be re-used for other projects. This backend was written for nodejs and we successfully re-used it for another new projet during my last month there.
    <br />
    On the other hand, I had to maintain and to add new features to the React/Redux front-end which was using the GraphQL backend. This also implied to turn the design coming from the UX designers of the team into a clean and responsive html/css.
    <br />
    We were using continuous integration for the whole process, through Bitbucket and Codeship. The product was deployed as a docker image into ECS with the help of CloudFormation.
